I'm honestly a little unsure how to start this project. I guess maybe I can tell you a little about what I hope to achieve here.

In my never ending quest to become a better software engineer, I read a lot of articles passively. Most of the time, this happens in the late evening while winding down before bed. This has worked somewhat well at keeping me engaged and up-to-date with where the community is headed.

That said, reading by itself isn't enough when you're trying to _learn_ challenging material, like data structures, algorithms, and the inner workings of a JavaScript engine.

It is said, and I have experienced this first-hand, the best way to learn something is to teach it. To that end, I'm going to be posting about the topics mentioned above (and others!), explaining them in what I hope will be easy to follow and digestible write ups.

I hope that you get as much out of reading them as I have gotten out of writing them.
