[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) defines an algorithm as:
> A sequence of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

According to Donald E. Knuth in "[The Art of Computer Programming](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html)", an algorithm possesses five characteristics:

1. __Finiteness__: An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps, of course this doesn't mean that the number of steps might no be arbitrarily large.
1. __Definiteness__: Each step must be precisely clearly defined. They cannot be ambiguous.
1. __Input__: An algorithm takes zero or more parameters.
1. __Output__: An algorithm has at least one output.
1. __Effectiveness__: In principle, an algorithm must be able to be completed by person using a pencil and paper in a finite amount of time.
