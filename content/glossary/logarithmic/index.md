A logarithm can be defined as the inverse of exponentiation. Stated another way, it is the power to which a number (also known as the base) must be raised to produce a given number.

## Example

Logarithms are written like: <code>log<sub>2</sub>16 = 4</code>.

It helps me to think about them algebraically. Written algebraically, <code>log<sub>2</sub>16x</code> is equivalent to `2^x = 16`. In this case, `x = 4`
